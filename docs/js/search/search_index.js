(bits per second).\ngetKbps() - Get the current internet speed in Kbps (kilobits per second).\ngetMbps() - Get the current internet speed in Mbps (megabits per second).\nisOnline() - Check if the network is available.\n\nSettings\n\nfile - see File Settings (below)\niterations - (default: 3) The number of speed readings to take for the average. \nIncrease iterations the more accurate results, decrease iterations for faster results.\nretryDelay - (default: 500) The number of milliseconds to wait before the next iteration after a network error\n\nFile Settings\n\n[path] - (default: ~5Mb image stored on GitHub) The URL where to download an image for determining internet speed. \nOther Included Paths \n~500 KB (408949 kb) -
